## Project Structure

Inside of Dante Astro theme, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── utils/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── tailwind.config.cjs
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro (`.astro`) components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Astro.js Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

## Deploying the Project 

# Step 1: Add and commit your changes (optional, saves your work)
git add .
git commit -m "Update source files"

# Step 2: Push changes to the main branch (optional)
git push origin main

# Step 3: Build the project (creates the `dist/` folder)
npm run build

# Step 4: Deploy the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
npm run deploy

# Manually Add .nojekyll (if needed)
If for some reason .nojekyll is not being deployed properly, you can manually add it to the gh-pages branch:

git checkout gh-pages

touch .nojekyll

git add .nojekyll
git commit -m "Add .nojekyll to root of gh-pages"
git push origin gh-pages

# note
The .nojekyll file is a special marker used by GitHub Pages to disable Jekyll processing. By default, GitHub Pages runs Jekyll, a static site generator, which can ignore files and directories that start with an underscore (among other behaviors). If you're using a different static site generator or have files that Jekyll might accidentally skip, adding an empty .nojekyll file in the root of your repository tells GitHub Pages to serve all files as they are, without any Jekyll processing.
